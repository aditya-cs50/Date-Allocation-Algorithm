# Date-Allocation-Algorithm

I created this algorithm to assist with the allocation of duties to personnel in the military. 
This algorithm allocates duties in a fair way, as governed by a set of rules in the helper.py file. In brief, there are three different duties - weekday, friday and weekday (not inclusive of friday) duties.
It also avoids allocating days to people if they have "blocked out" that day as being unavailable. Additionally, it has a few other constraints (not allocating duties to personnel in 2 or more consecutive days, avoiding allocating the same personnel the main and reserve duty in any one day, etc.
